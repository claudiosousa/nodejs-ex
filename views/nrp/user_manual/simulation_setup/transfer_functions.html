<h1>Transfer Functions with PyTF<a class="headerlink" href="#transfer-functions-with-pytf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Abstraction is about concentrating on the essential parts of a system. To explain what we
see as essential in the connection between a robot and a spiking
neuronal network, we begin with the explanation of the domain-specific language (DSL) that captures
these essential parts.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<span id="closed-loop"></span><img alt="../../../_images/closedLoop.png" src="../../../_images/closedLoop.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 1 </span><span class="caption-text">A Closed Loop between Neuronal Networks and Robots</span></p>
</div>
<p>Our main way of connecting spiking neuronal networks with robots
are transfer functions which you can see in <a class="reference internal" href="#closed-loop"><span>Fig. 1</span></a>.
Transfer functions consist of connections between the simulators
and some code which details how the data of one simulator should be
transmitted to the other. The code is mainly trivial as the
purpose of most transfer functions is limited to transmission, simple
arithmetic adjustments and multiplexing the data from different parts of
the simulators. The role of the simulators is to some extent
interchangeable, in that they take information from other simulators and output
information into other simulators, but the way how this is implemented differs for
spiking neuronal networks and robots.</p>
<div class="section" id="abstract-syntax">
<h2>Abstract Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The basic idea behind PyTF is that the specification of a
transfer function (that is how the input from a transfer function is
converted to a robot control signal) can be written as a regular
Python function. The role of PyTF is to wrap Python functions
into transfer functions, map their parameters to parts of either a
neuronal network or a robot simulation and manage the execution of this
function.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<span id="transfer-functions"></span><img alt="../../../_images/transferFunctions.png" src="../../../_images/transferFunctions.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 2 </span><span class="caption-text">The abstract syntax of PyTF</span></p>
</div>
<p>The abstract syntax of PyTF to achieve this functionality is depicted in
<a class="reference internal" href="#transfer-functions"><span>Fig. 2</span></a>. A transfer function consists of an
underlying Python function and parameter mapping specifications.
Multiple types of parameter mappings exist in order to connect to either
a neuronal simulation or a robotics simulation. In principle, we
differentiate between mappings to the neuronal network
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SpikeMapping</span></code>), to the robotics simulation (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RobotMapping</span></code>) and to
internal variables. The mapping specifications for the simulators each
have subclasses to specify whether the parameter is an input or an output
to/from the simulation.</p>
<p>As the parameter mapping specifications are contained in the transfer
functions, a transfer function does not have external references. In
particular, the deployment of transfer functions could be distributed to
multiple nodes which is useful if the transfer functions contain some computational
expensive logic.</p>
<p>All parameter mappings share an attribute specifying which parameter
they belong to and a method to create a device from the mapping
specification. This creates an adapter component instance in the case of a
mapping to a simulation or just yields a reference to a local or global
variable. For this, a reference to the surrounding TF Manager is passed
into the mapping specification that contains references to the
communication adapters for both neuronal and robotics simulation. The
mapping specifications can then create the device independently of the
concrete simulator used at either side.</p>
<p>PyTF has two subtypes of transfer functions, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Robot2Neuron</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Neuron2Robot</span></code>, represented by the upper and lower transfer functions
in <a class="reference internal" href="#closed-loop"><span>Fig. 1</span></a>. The rationale behind this decision is
simply to order transfer functions in the unlikely case that a control
topic is both read from and written to. Thus, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Robot2Neuron</span></code> transfer
functions are executed first. On the other hand, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Neuron2Robot</span></code>
transfer functions often result in sending a message to a particular
robot control topic. For this rather common case, the class contains a
reference to a publisher so that the transfer function may simply use
the return value of the function to publish on this topic. Other than
that, the type of transfer functions has no implications on the allowed
parameter mappings. In particular, a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Robot2Neuron</span></code> transfer function
may for example also contain a publisher or a spike sink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="neuron-access-patterns">
<h2>Neuron Access Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#neuron-access-patterns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whereas robot control signals or sensory inputs from the robot can be
bundled in arbitrary data structures sent over ROS, the interface of a
neuron is determined through its underlying neuron model. In many cases
this interface is limited to a few parameters such as the membrane
potential or a history of spikes. As a consequence, a single control
signal for a robot is often multiplexed to a multitude of neurons and
vice versa sensory inputs such as a camera image are fed into a
multitude of neurons. Therefore, transfer functions are often required to
connect multiple neurons at once.</p>
<p>Spikes (the usual interface of a neuron in a
spiking neural network) are discrete in time whereas control commands for
robots usually consist of continuous data sent to the robot in short
intervals. Likewise, sensory inputs from the robot that will be
transmitted to the neural network need to be discretized to spikes. To
perform these conversions, there are multiple approaches. This includes
integration of spikes to obtain continuous data from spikes and
generating a current of spikes either constantly or according to some
probability distribution, most notably Poisson distributions.</p>
<p>In PyTF users can choose between a set of predefined access patterns.
Each connection to a particular set of neurons and
according to a given access pattern is realized by an object we call a
device (as this terminology is also partially used in the neural
simulators) where the access pattern is called the device type.
Depending on whether the device is an input into the network (spike
source) or an output (spike sink), different device types apply. Each
device can be connected to arbitrary many neurons that can be selected
by navigating through the populations of the neuronal network model.</p>
<p>We support the following spike source device types:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Current Generators:</strong> The current generators for direct current,
alternating current or noisy current do not generate spikes but
inject currents of the specified type into all of the connected
neurons. These devices receive the amplitude of the generated current
as inputs. Here, the noisy current generator is rather a tool to test
whether the neuronal network currently simulated is robust with
regard to noise rather than being a good choice to encode sensory
inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Poisson Generator:</strong> A Poisson generator issues spikes according to
a Poisson distribution. Here, the inverse of the <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>
parameter can be set in accordance to sensory inputs. This inverse
reflects the rate in which spikes are generated by this device.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Frequency Generator:</strong> A fixed frequency generator
deterministically generates spikes at a given frequency. Here, the
frequency is set as a parameter and can be adjusted to sensory
inputs. Unlike the other spike generators, this device type is not
directly implemented in neuronal simulators but can be implemented by
connecting a current generator with an integrate-and-fire neuron.</li>
</ol>
<p>This selection is based on the observation that neural simulators (in
particular Nest) let simulated neurons communicate through the delivery
of spikes and currents. Based on the experiments we have performed so far
using the platform, we believe that this list is sufficient for most
applications. However, we plan to support new device types should they
be demanded by users of the NRP.</p>
<p>The following spike sinks are supported:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Leaky Integrators:</strong> The concept of leaky integrators is to simply
integrate spikes coming from a neuron under observation and add a
leak term to it. The rationale behind this is that in spiking
neuronal networks, the membrane potential is highly fragile. Shortly
after a spike has been issued, the membrane potential is reset and
therefore, it has a high importance whether any measurement is taken
before or after a neuron spikes. Therefore, we augment the neuronal
network with an additional leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with an
infinite threshold potential (so that it never spikes) and measure
the membrane potential of this neuron. The result is much less
fragile and therefore appropriate to be used for robot control
signals.</li>
<li><strong>Population Rate:</strong> Another very common pattern is to simply take the
average incoming spike rate of a neuron or a range of neurons. This
is again relatively stable and can be used for translation into robot
control signals.</li>
<li><strong>Spike Recorder:</strong> The simplest thing a spike sink can do is to
simply record all spikes issued to a neuron under observation.
However, this has two major drawbacks. At first, the communication
overhead is increased since all spikes are transmitted between the
neuronal simulation and the transfer function but more importantly the
transfer function has to make sense of this series of spikes. This
allows great flexibility as this approach is extensible, but it
is not suited for general use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, this list contains the device types that we think are suitable for a
range of applications and we do not claim that this list is
sufficient for all experiments. This list is subject to change.
Rarely used device types may be removed whereas device
types frequently asked for may be added.</p>
<p>The implementation on how exactly a given device type is created is
up to the communication adapter that will create the
appropriate communication objects. For example, the leaky integrator
device can be implemented in Nest by simply inserting a new
integrate-and-fire neuron with adequately set parameters and an infinite
spiking threshold so that the result is directly available as the
membrane potential of the additionally inserted neuron. This is possible
since the Nest simulator runs in main memory and therefore allows
different modes of communication. Other simulators such as SpiNNaker are only based
on spike-based communication. Here, the implementation of the
leaky integrator would be to record the spikes and to do the
integration manually.</p>
<p>Each of these device types have their own additional configuration such
as weights and delays in which the spikes are issued to spike generators
or from existing neurons into leaky integrators. On the other hand, all
devices share the connection specification towards the neuronal
simulator, that we call <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NeuronSelector</span></code> (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="#transfer-functions"><span>Fig. 2</span></a>).
This is a function that given a model of the neuronal network selects the
neuron a device should be connected to. This includes entire populations but
also views and assemblies.</p>
<p>While a single device is sufficient to transmit simple sensory data to
the network or issue command control signals to the robot, the
transmission of complex sensory inputs such as camera images requires
multiple devices connected to different neurons each. This is the reason
that a device mapping can specify not only a single but multiple neuron
selectors. In the case that multiple neuron selectors are present, the framework
won&#8217;t create just a single device but one for each neuron selector.</p>
<p>The advantage of these device groups is that they aggregate the values
from individual devices to arrays, making this a suitable choice when
the data in the robotics simulator is available as an
array. This is the case for camera inputs that can then transmitted to an array of Poisson generators.
Furthermore, device groups can be configured comfortably as in these scenarios
devices usually share large proportions of their configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mapping-to-python">
<h2>Mapping to Python<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-to-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Applying a typical query-and-command programming interface for managing
transfer functions would presumably result in verbose schematic code.
Thus, we use techniques from the
area of domain-specific languages to raise the abstraction level of the
target platform by means of an internal DSL, PyTF. With PyTF, we obtain
a more concise representation of transfer functions. Users can specify
transfer functions as regular Python functions decorated with their
connections to neuronal and world simulators. The coordination regarding
data synchronization and simulation orchestration is hidden in the
platform abstractions.</p>
<p>We chose an internal DSL and Python as a host language because
Python is popular both among robotics and neuroscience users. Given the
research results from Meyerovich that suggest that developers
do not like to change their primary language, we wanted to make the
barrier for neuroscientists as low as possible. There is a Python API for both the neuronal
simulations and the robotics side. Large parts of the
framework are implemented in Python and this allows an easy
implementation of the DSL as a Python API.</p>
<p>To implement transfer functions in PyTF, we have decided on using the Python decorator
syntax. A first set of decorators turn a regular Python function into a
transfer function and a second set specifies parameter
mappings. Everything else, including the neuron access
patterns and device types is specified as parameters for these
decorators.</p>
<p>A consequence of this design is the name of the classes in the abstract
syntax. They are named to be as understandable as possible.</p>
<p>In particular, the classes <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Neuron2Robot</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Robot2Neuron</span></code> create
a new transfer function object with no reference to any regular Python
function. When used as a decorator and applied to a Python function, the
underlying Python function of the transfer function is set and
placeholders for the parameter mappings are created (Python allows to
retrieve the parameter names of a method using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inspect</span></code> module).</p>
<p>The mapping specification classes <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MapSpikeSource</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MapSpikeSink</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MapVariable</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MapRobotPublisher</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MapRobotSubscriber</span></code> then
create a parameter mapping specification object that when called with a
transfer function replaces the according placeholder with themselves and
returns the transfer function to allow other parameters to be mapped. If
no appropriate placeholder exists, an error message is thrown.</p>
<p>The configuration for mapping specifications is passed as arguments to
the decorator representing the parameter mapping. Here, the device
mappings are interesting as they allow the most detailed
configuration. In particular, they contain a specification to which
neurons a device should be connected as a function selecting the neurons
for a given model of the neuronal network. However, as we do not want
our users to bother with the details of lambda functions, we created a small API to allow them to write
such functions as if they were operating on an assumed neuronal network
model directly.</p>
<p>To specify multiple neuron selectors, a list of neuron selectors must be
passed into the neuronal network constructor. In PyTF, we support a
mapping operator that construct such lists of neuron selectors based on
a lambda function and a concatenation operator to express more complex
patterns. These operators make use of the knowledge that neuron
selectors must not be nested deeper than in one list (i.e. it is not
permitted to specify a list of a list of neuron selectors for a device)
and flatten these lists when required.</p>
