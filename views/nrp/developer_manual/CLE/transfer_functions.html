<h2>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The transfer functions describe how spikes from the neuronal simulation are to be translated into
commands for a robot and how the sensor data from the robot should be translated back to spikes.
This translation is written/specified by the users of the Neurorobotics project, who are neuroscientists.
Thus, a framework is provided to make the specification of these transfer functions as easy as
possible for the users by abstracting away the technical details as much as possible. This framework is
referred to as Transfer Functions framework (TF framework).</p>
<p>The TF framework is part of the CLE: <a class="reference internal" href="cle_architecture.html"><em>CLE architecture</em></a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="functional-requirements">
<h2>Functional Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The neurons of the NEST brain simulator occasionally send spikes (these are messages with no data content except
for the neuron that sent it and a timestamp). Furthermore, the NEST brain simulator is clocked, which means that
spikes can only be sent at the speed ratio of the brain simulation. However, a neuron does not have
to spike in every time-frame.</p>
<p>The transfer functions transfer this spike data into a continuous data stream for the robot. This means that for
every robot topic, a message is sent for every time-step even if no neuron that the
transfer function needs has spiked. As a consequence, all transfer functions must be evaluated
at every time-step. The time resolution for the transfer functions is not necessarily the same
as for the brain simulation, it can instead be a multiple of it. Typical time resolutions that we are using
are 5ms for the brain simulation and 100ms for the TFs. Within this time span, a neuron may spike up
to 100/5=20 times.</p>
<p>For this reason, the spike data from the neuronal simulation is only accessed indirectly through so
called devices. In a neuronal simulation, devices are little programs that are injected into a neuronal
network, they run with the same clock as the neuronal simulation and can be accessed from outside. A
typical example is a leaky integrator that basically returns the voltage of a neuron.
<strong>However, within the TF framework, we also refer to the adapter objects that connect these devices with the TF framework devices</strong>,
so we identify these adapters with the devices that they adapt.</p>
<p>A transfer function may access spikes of an arbitrary number of neurons and the spikes of a neuron may be used
by an arbitrary number of transfer functions. Consecutive neurons can be grouped together in arrays to make
the specification of transfer functions easier. A transfer function may require
spikes of both grouped and single neurons.</p>
<p>Transfer functions create (or read from, depending on the direction) multiple typed robot topics. The
user (i.e. the neuroscientist) is responsible for ensuring that the data sent to a particular robot topic
matches the type of the topic. This can also be checked by a compiler, although this feature is not
mandatory and depends on the specification language of the transfer function.</p>
<p>A common requirement for all transfer functions is that they hold a state. Furthermore, the state
should be sharable among multiple transfer functions to allow maximal flexibility of the framework.
The transfer functions should have a specified execution order to get an intuitive understanding of
side effects.</p>
<p>For the transfer functions from the robot sensors to the neuronal simulator, the TF
framework should establish the minimal amount of assumptions on the spike generation schemes,
i.e. there should be no restriction on the pattern in which spikes are sent to the neurons. However,
neuroscientists should be able to specify common spike generation schemes like frequencies, i.e. to
send spikes to a particular neuron in a frequency that is higher than the incoming rate of
sensor data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-requirements">
<h2>Technical Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the neuroscience community, the programming language Python has gained a good popularity. Thus,
it is important to allow neuroscientists to write TFs in Python if they want. Further considerations to use C++
were abandoned, as the simulator is also controlled using Python. Furthermore, we can
use CPython to convert Python code to C if want to reduce the performance impact of using Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture-overview">
<h2>Architecture Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The transfer functions are a part of the Closed Loop Engine (CLE) and are situated between the
neuronal simulator (“the brain”) and Gazebo (our world simulation engine (WSE)). Thus, they have an
interface to the neuronal simulator on one side and an interface to Gazebo on the other.
However, to ensure that we can test the transfer functions separately, the communication to the
neuronal simulator and to Gazebo is hidden behind interfaces and the functionality is provided to
the TF framework by adapters.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#tf-overview"><span>Fig. 11</span></a> shows the architecture of the CLE. The transfer functions are the
important component in the middle that transfers data between the two simulators, the neuronal
simulator at the one side and the world simulation engine at the other. Both Simulators are accessed
through adapters that represent their functionality and can be replaced with appropriate mocks when
necessary. The transfer functions are controlled by the Closed Loop Controller which is responsible
for orchestrating the transfer functions with the simulations. The ROS adapter implements the Robot
Communication Adapter interface via publishing and subscribing to ROS topics, whereas the PyNN Brain
Adapter fulfills its interface by delegating the calls to NEST via the PyNN interface. This common
interface allows us to use either NEST, SpiNNaker, Neuron or a mock.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 11 </span><span class="caption-text">Architecture of the Closed Loop Engine</span></p>
</div>
<p>The interfaces relevant for the above architecture of the CLE are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#tf-interfaces"><span>Fig. 12</span></a>.
The transfer functions provide three methods that initialize them and call the transfer functions in
either direction.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="tf-interfaces"></span><img alt="../../../_images/architecture_interfaces.png" src="../../../_images/architecture_interfaces.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 12 </span><span class="caption-text">Interfaces of the Closed Loop Engine</span></p>
</div>
<p>The transfer functions rely on the interfaces for the robot communication
and the communication to the neuronal simulator. Both communication adapters provide an interface to
initialize them and register the data which will eventually be retrieved or sent. For this purpose, the
transfer functions call the appropriate adapter to create a communication object that can be used to
send or receive data. Appropriate interfaces for such communication objects exist for both robot and
neuronal simulator sides.</p>
<p>The neuronal simulator interface is dependent on the used device type whereas
the interface for the robot adapter is fixed. This is due to the fact that all robot properties are
exposed through topics, whereas the data from the neuronal simulation are most efficiently fetched
using devices. That is, the neuronal simulation is instrumented with devices that run within the
neuronal simulator and get executed by the neuronal simulator for every time-step of the neuronal
simulator. These devices can either record the spikes in a certain way or are allowed to issue spikes.
Typically, these devices have a low configuration overhead, a frequency-based spike generator for
instance only needs the frequency in which to issue spikes.</p>
<p>The supported spike detectors are a voltage device and a spike recorder device. The first
simply records the voltage of a neuron at a given time, whereas the spike recorder records whether a
particular neuron has spiked over the last period of time. The supported spike generation patterns
include for the start a fixed frequency, a Poisson-based spike generation and a pattern spike
generator.</p>
<p>The TF framework communicates with the neuronal simulator only
through such devices in order to minimize the communication overhead and maximize performance.</p>
<p>An important requirement for the TF framework is that the TF node should only receive spikes that it needs,
and likewise for the robot topics. To lower the amount of specification
that we need from the user, this information is extracted from the specification of the
transfer functions.</p>
<p>There are two different kinds of transfer functions. The first kind,
Neuron2Robot, transfers spikes from the neuronal simulator to topics for the WSE. The other kind,
Robot2Neuron transfers data the opposite way.</p>
<p>A transfer function consists of three parts.</p>
<p>The first part is specifying in the transfer function the data sources from which it receives data. For
Neuron2Robot, this is typically neuronal simulator devices (a transfer function may receive input
from multiple devices), whereas for Robot2Neuron it is robot topics, where again multiple topics are
allowed. However, both Neuron2Robot and Robot2Neuron transfer functions may consume data from either
simulation.</p>
<p>The second part of the transfer function specifies where the output data should be sent.
For a Neuron2Robot transfer function, this typically is a
robot topic but there is no limitation. Both Neuron2Robot and Robot2Neuron transfer functions may
target robot topics, brain devices or a combination of both.</p>
<p>The third part of a transfer function is the actual function, i.e. how the robot
topics and device configuration (either for sending or receiving data) are connected. This specification
can be done through arbitrary Python code. The data source is fed into the function as a formal
parameter, whereas the return value is taken and sent to the target sink, i.e. the targeted robot
topic or device. Further communication is possible through communication objects directly.</p>
<p>A quick overview on how these concepts are implemented in the TF framework can be found <a class="reference internal" href="../../tutorials/transfer_function/index.html"><em>here</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transfer-function-framework-architecture">
<h2>Transfer Function Framework Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#transfer-function-framework-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="initialization">
<h3>Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Initialization of a TF node is straightforward. In the initialization, the TF node
initializes the adapters for both the robot and neuronal simulator. The initialization also includes
the setup and registration of the transfer functions, i.e. to connect the transfer functions with their
necessary communication objects.</p>
<p>These communication objects (robot publishers or subscribers, brain devices) are declared in
annotations of the transfer function that map a parameter to a given communication object specification.
The transfer function manager resolves this specification and creates an appropriate communication
object for this request.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="tf-initialization"></span><img alt="../../../_images/tf_initialization.png" src="../../../_images/tf_initialization.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 13 </span><span class="caption-text">Initialization of a TF node</span></p>
</div>
<p>The sequence of the initialization is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#tf-initialization"><span>Fig. 13</span></a>. The initialization of
the TF node is triggered from the closed loop controller, either through in-process communication or
remotely. The TF node then makes sure that the dependent adapters are initialized and creates the
communication objects necessary for the transfer functions.</p>
<p>However, the sequence in Figure 3 only visualizes the normal case that Neuron2Robot transfer functions
actually transfer neuronal spike data to robot streams and likewise for Robot2Neuron. In the general
case, a Neuron2Robot transfer function may also generate spikes or use a topic subscriber whereas a
Robot2Neuron transfer function may access neuronal spike sinks such as voltmeters as well. The
distinction between Neuron2Robot and Robot2Neuron is merely to adjust the effort necessary to run the
transfer functions in either direction so that they can be executed in parallel.
Thus, the registration at the communication adapter is routed through the parameter mapping object,
i.e. the annotation that maps the parameter to the communication object.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-the-transfer-functions">
<h3>Running the transfer functions<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-transfer-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Due to the requirement that transfer functions must run even in the case where no neurons needed by a
transfer function spiked, we need the TF framework to run clocked synchronized with the NEST brain
simulation, but with a lower time resolution than the neuronal simulator. Responsible for this
synchronization is the closed loop controller, which calls the transfer functions.</p>
<p>As the spikes from a neuron can be accessed by multiple transfer functions, the current state of a
device from the neuronal simulator is cached in the TF node. The same holds for robot topics, where
incoming messages are buffered to be processed by transfer functions separately.</p>
<p>The sequence diagram for a TF node implementing transfer functions in both directions is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#tf-iteration"><span>Fig. 14</span></a>. At any time, the TF node may receive incoming data from the robot via
callbacks of subscribed ROS topics. These calls simply update the current cached state of the robot
sensors.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id4">
<span id="tf-iteration"></span><img alt="../../../_images/tf_iteration.png" src="../../../_images/tf_iteration.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 14 </span><span class="caption-text">Iteration of a TF node</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once again, only the standard case where Neuron2Robot transfer functions transfer from the neuronal
simulator to the robot and vice versa for the Robot2Neuron transfer functions is shown. Furthermore,
unlike in Figure 4, refreshing the devices on either side is now done directly by the Closed Loop
controller and no longer by the TF manager.</p>
<p>Eventually, the closed loop controller calls the TF node to either run all transfer functions
transferring data from the neuronal simulator to the WSE or vice versa. These calls may also be done
in parallel and so the methods to run transfer functions must be thread-safe.</p>
<p>When the closed loop controller asks the TF node to call all transfer functions that transfer robot
messages to spikes for the neuronal simulator, the TF node runs all Robot2Neuron transfer functions.
Within the body of these functions, the device status may be updated. This device is given to the
transfer function as a formal parameter. For the data source, the cached values from the buffered
robot messages are used.</p>
<p>Conversely, the closed loop adapter may also call the TF node to run the transfer functions from the
neuronal simulator to robot messages. For this, the TF node will call the brain adapter to refresh
all cached device states. Then, the Neuron2Robot transfer functions are called. They take the current
cached device status as input and return some value or the default value None. The return value of
these transfer functions is sent to the predefined robot message by the TF framework. However
Neuron2Robot transfer functions are also allowed to send messages on their own within their function
body.</p>
<p>All transfer functions are evaluated at every simulation loop of the Closed Loop Engine, but
possibly on a lower time resolution than the neuronal simulator. They operate on buffered data from
the robot sensors, but also get a flag indicating whether these values have changed since the last
loop. Transfer functions are evaluated in order of their appearance in the specification so that side
effects happen in an intuitive manner. Sophisticated spike generation patterns are the subject of further
helper classes.</p>
<p>The patterns for the spike generators are supported by custom spike generator classes, which are
implemented separately and called within the transfer function. This design makes it easier to import
other spike generators as neuroscience discovers new spike generation patterns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="device-specification">
<h3>Device specification<a class="headerlink" href="#device-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Unlike the robotic simulation whose elements are identified simply by a topic and its type, the
interaction mechanisms to interact with the neuronal simulator are richer, particularly because the
neuronal simulation typically runs on a higher time resolution than the TFs and any interaction needs
to run with maximum performance which often requires specialized solutions.</p>
<p>There are two main elements that make up a device specification.</p>
<div class="section" id="device-type-specification">
<h4>Device type specification<a class="headerlink" href="#device-type-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The first one is a specification of the device type and the second one is the specification of the
neurons that should be connected to the device.</p>
<p>The device type specification is very simple if predefined device types are used. This includes the
following spike sinks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spike Recorder: Simply tells whether any spike was issued to the device</li>
<li>Leaky integrator alpha: Gets the membrane voltage of a current-based LIF neuron with alpha-shaped post-synaptic currents</li>
<li>Leaky integrator exp: Gets the membrane voltage of a current-based LIF neuron with decaying-exponential post-synaptic current</li>
<li>Population Rate: Gets the frequency of incoming spikes</li>
</ul>
<p>and the following spike sources:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed frequency: Generates spikes at a fixed frequency. The rate sets the frequency in which spikes are generated.</li>
<li>Poisson: Generates spikes based on a Poisson distribution. The rate sets the parameter of the Poisson distribution.</li>
<li>AC, DC and NC source: Issue current to connected neurons. The amplitude defines the maximal current issued to the neurons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details on the device types can be found in the brain interface module <code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">hbp_nrp_cle.brainsim.BrainInterface</span></code></p>
<p>Additionally, developers may add custom devices that can take over the coupling to a neuronal
simulator given a brain communication adapter, see <a class="reference internal" href="../../tutorials/transfer_function/deviceGroups.html"><em>Tutorial: Accessing multiple neurons with device groups</em></a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="neuron-selection-specification">
<h4>Neuron selection specification<a class="headerlink" href="#neuron-selection-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The second specification item for a device is the specification of the neurons that should be
connected to the device. Whereas robot topics can be easily identified by their topic names, we
designed the neuron selection to be adjustable by the developer. At the same time, we want the neuron
selection to be decoupled from the brain in order to decouple it from the actual neuronal simulator.</p>
<p>This decoupling is especially important since the neuron selection must be possible before the brain
(i.e. the neuronal network that is to be simulated) is initialized. This is because the TFs are
decoupled from the brain simulation and can thus be specified before the brain is loaded. The brain
must only be available when the TF manager is initialized and binds the TFs to a particular brain
communication adapter and robot communication adapter.</p>
<p>For this reason, we invented a property path indexing mechanism. That means that we record the
navigation from an assumed brain model root element and replay the navigation as soon as we have the
brain model initialized.</p>
